The very first Bob's Birder's feeder has been serving our yard friends for over fifteen months now. It's seen a full year of [Willamette Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willamette_Valley) weather and an extra autumn to boot. I'm pleased to report that there is very little damage or deformation and the cleaning effort has been reasonable. But the rascal squirrels have, on occasion, managed to remove the gate and dump the seed tray. They also pried up one corner of the counter top. But all-in-all, I think the the cedar 4x4 has taken the bunt of the damage.

*I'm currently working on a locking seed tray gate.*

I fill the feeder every other day which has let the squirrels and jays figure out the schedule. When I go into our garage in the evening they start to gather. It's been great entertainment for out cats.

I am impressed at how well it's held up. It's gotten more time in use than I expected. There are often squirrels sitting on the counter, one after another, for hours at a time. And even with all that there's been no deformation of the floor or bending of the stools. The jays and crows like to hand out on the roof, but you'd never know it to look at it.

## Ongoing care

About once a month I wash and sterilize the seed tray and wipe the restaurant down with a bleach wipe. Periodically I give the whole restaurant a good wash with a brush in hot soapy water followed by a soak in beach water and rinse. This 15 month mark was the first time I did a damage assessment and had to reglue the corner of the of the counter top.
