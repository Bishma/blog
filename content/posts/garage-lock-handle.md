# Thank you for your service, vice-grips

The reason I wanted to get a 3D printer was to make solutions for common problems so designing my own models was always a goal. I decided a good first project would be to replace our missing interior garage door handle. It was missing when we bought out house and for the first 5 years we lived here we made due using a pair of vice grips to turn the spindle.

This was my first 3D design but so far it's holding up.
