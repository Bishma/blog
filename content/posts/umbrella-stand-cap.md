# {{< param description >}}

When we take our outdoor umbrella down for the season we like to put something over the remaining part of the stand. In years past we made use of an old travel mug, a plastic bag, and some duct tape. This year as we were taking it down Bonnie said, "hey, I'll bet you can design and print a cap for that." Spoiler: she was right.

## Design

This was a straight forward design in Fusion 360. It took so little time I decided to model and print an umbrella to go with it. I still ended up doing it pretty quick, this is far from the most printable thing I've ever designed. Every orientation of the umbrella seemed to result in nasty overhangs, so at the end of the day I just printed it {{< lightbox-link image="/images/umbrella-stand-cap/support example.jpg" gallery="design" >}}with a load of supports{{< /lightbox-link >}}.

The pole on our umbrella is {{< lightbox-link image="/images/umbrella-stand-cap/sketch.png" gallery="design" >}}43.25mm in diameter{{< /lightbox-link >}} with two lock pins that are 9.35mm in diameter and 33..95mm from its top.

## Printing

The umbrella needs a layer height of 0.15mm and I decided to print both pieces on one place.

* Layer Height: 0.15mm
* Infill: 20%
* Supports: Umbrella Only

Carefully remove the supports from the umbrella without breaking the umbrella pole. If you have any elephant footing you may need to clean up the bottom of the pole before it will insert into the cap. Use a drop of super glue to attach the two.

## Material

I decided to go with PETG since it's more UV resistant than PLA. Plus this Prusament Galaxy Black looks fun in {{< lightbox-link image="/images/umbrella-stand-cap/in use.jpg" >}}the daylight{{< /lightbox-link >}}.
